# Smart-Contract-Development
The development of e-invoice smart contracts using blockchain technology has revolutionized the way organizations operate in a decentralized environment. This project builds upon an existing implementation of the Decentralized Autonomous Association (DAA), which simulates the functionalities of a physical organization on the blockchain. This project aims to extend the capabilities of the DAA by incorporating two additional functionalities. Firstly, the project enables third parties, whether associated with the organization or not, to donate Ethereum (ETH) to the association's address. In return, these third parties receive equivalent ERC20 tokens named "DONA" tokens in their digital asset portfolio. This feature promotes transparency, security, and accountability in the donation process, leveraging the inherent benefits of blockchain technology.
